# Manjots__Campfire_song

At the campfire
When you sing a song
You summon the Campfire Man
As the fire rages on

Be careful around him 
his skin burns hot
Even as the fire grows dim
His skin does not

Don't reach in too far with your hand
When at the campfire with the Campfire Man
You'll see flames in the sky
The Campfire man, flyin up high

Even during the coldest of nights
when the thunder strikes
He'll still burn away
Until he fades to gray

His ashes fall
Like the leaves from a tree 
That stand up tall
He is the Campfire man, who is all to see
